# Coin-Wheel

This project (working title: Coin Wheel) is overall a game of strategy and chance.

The game is played by spinning a wheel with coins facing heads or tails in slots on it. Each turn, a select number of the coins are revealed to the player and the player can then choose to flip a number of the coins from heads to tails or tails to heads. The goal of the game, or the condition to win, is if all the coins, at the end of a turn, are all facing heads or all facing tails.

## Installing
Before you can play the game, ensure you have Java 8 installed. You must open a terminal (or copy and paste from here) and run `javac *.java`. To run the game program, type or copy `java Coins`.

## State of the Project
The game is not in a "playable" state just yet. The code as it stands creates a wheel and displays it without hiding coins, then displays it as the user will see it in the playable version of the game. In the case that a win is achieved with the starting state of the wheel, the win is recognized.

## Next Steps
The next step for the project is to complete the user-playable game.
The ultimate goal of the project is to be able to not only play the game, but run it many times, with different strategies, and compare statistics based on the different strategies.
